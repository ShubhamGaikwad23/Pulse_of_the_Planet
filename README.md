Heart disease, a leading cause of global mortality, presents complex challenges for public health. Traditional heart disease analysis, limited by small datasets and conventional methods, lacks comprehensive insights. This project employs Big Data and machine learning to deeply analyze heart disease factors and predictions. Our goal is to improve early detection, inform prevention, and tailor treatments. This approach aims for better health outcomes and reduced healthcare burdens.
